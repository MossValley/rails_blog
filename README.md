# Rails Blog

This is a basic blog webpage created using Ruby on Rails as part of The Odin Project's [Ruby on Rails project: Blog App](https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/full-stack-ruby-on-rails/courses/ruby-on-rails/lessons/ruby-on-rails-ruby-on-rails)

This is currently pretty basic as it was my first time dealing with rails by myself. It's not visually much at this point but can be fleshed out.

This will be deployed on [Heroku](https://devcenter.heroku.com/) soon and I will add a link to this [here].

**Features**

* Articles - authorised users can add articles and delete articles and comments

* Comments - anyone can add a comment to any article

**Things of note:**

* Ruby version: 2.6.5

* Database: used PostGres instead of rails' native SQLite as Heroku relies on a database that can be stored outside of memory to avoid losing data

**Things to add**

* Beautify the pages?

* Add option for people to create a log on?
